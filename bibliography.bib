abstract = {Accurate performance prediction of large PV systems with shading is challenging because computational complexity increases with system size. Solar Farmer is a new PV performance model with 3-D shading. Comparing predictions with measurements from the NIST PV test bed we observed a decrease in the annual difference of 17{\%} between module and submodule shading. By varying the resolution of shading from module to cell level, we also determined that 5 points persubmodule, resulting in a 0.5{\%} annual difference, was sufficient to accurately predict performance of shaded systems. Therefore, a balance of accuracy and computational expense was achieved allowing performance predictions of large PV systems with shade.},

abstract = {Closed-form equations of the true-tracking angle, backtracking angle, shaded fraction, and orientation angles of single-axis solar trackers installed on arbitrarily oriented slopes are derived. These slope-aware adjustments are necessary to successfully prevent row to row shading in arrays with nonzero cross-axis slope. A tracker rotation modeling procedure comprising these equations is provided.},

abstract = {The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) provides gridded satellite-based data sets for the United States and other parts of North and South America using cloud properties retrieved from the Geostationary Operational Environmental (GOES) series of satellites. These cloud properties in combination with ancillary atmospheric parameters are used in the Physical Solar Model (PSM) to compute solar radiation. This paper seeks to 1) describe the changes made in the PSM for the recent update to the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB 1998-2016) and 2) examine the performance of this update by comparing it to high-quality ground-based measurements. We summarize the changes to the input data for the radiative transfer models as well as updates for the processing algorithms. We also analyze the performance and accuracy of the NSRDB across the United States. Additional details of the data set and model are described in (1), (2), (3), and (4).},
